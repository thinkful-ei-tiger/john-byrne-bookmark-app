## This is my bookmark app. Here is what it allows a user to do:
- Add a bookmark for a website that contains a title, url link, description and a rating
- See bookmarks that they've already submitted to Thinkful's API. They appear in a collapsed form showing only the title and rating.
- User may click expand button that reveals the bookmark description and a link to the bookmarked website which opens in a new tab.
- User may delete bookmarks from the list.
- User may filter bookmarks by rating
